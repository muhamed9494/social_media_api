## Project Overview

The Social Media API provides endpoints for managing posts and users, implementing basic authentication using Django's built-in authentication system. It allows users to:
- Fetch, create, update, and delete posts.
- Register, log in, and manage user accounts.

The project also demonstrates basic **Django ORM** usage for interacting with the database and includes test coverage for core functionality.
